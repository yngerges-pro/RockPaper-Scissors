# RockPaper-Scissors
Computer rock, paper, scissors game

## How it is created
  I created a Java class with two methods: the main 
method and the "results" method. The main method collects user 
input from the user (rock, paper, scissors, or quit), where the input is 
named the variable "choice", and the computer chooses it's
own input by randomly selecting a number between 1-3 (inclusive) where 
it randomly chooses a number for the variable n, 
where 1 represent Rock, 2 represents Paper, and 3 Represents scissors.
By having the computer randomly choose rock, paper, or scissors, 
it gives the user a fair chance of winning the game with the computer.
Then, the main method calls upon the "results" method where the
computer states who won. If the computer wins, it prints
"I win!" If the user wins, it prints "You win!"
It loops the game over and over until the user
says quit. Try it!
